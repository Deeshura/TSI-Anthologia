Welcome to the TSI-Anthologia wiki! This is a one-stop shop for looking at documentation and design notes for the collab project.

It's organized into several sections, as follows;

## Chapters

Plot summaries of each of the game's chapters.

## Characters

Biographies and gameplay data for each playable and notable non-playable character.

Playable characters are sorted by their chapter of first appearance, whilst non-playable characters are sorted into their most notable chapters. For example, characters fought in boss fights are placed into the chapter where they are fought as a boss.

Includes style-guides for how to write a character's dialogue whilst remaining 'in character'.

## Dungeons

Design notes on each of the dungeons in the game, grouped by the chapters the dungeons appear in.

## Ground Maps

Design notes and documentation on the game's 'ground maps' that the player is allowed to run around in between missions.
