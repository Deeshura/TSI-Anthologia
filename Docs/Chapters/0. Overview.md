# Overview

TSI - Anthologia follows a (somewhat) anthological structure, where chapters one through to six are loosely connected stories that can be completed in any order. After finishing all of them, chapter seven will then become available, which ties together the remaining plot threads into a satisfying and grandiose conclusion.

A brief overview of each chapter, including the main characters of each, can be seen in the table below;
